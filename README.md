# color-match
Check whether the colour of a word is the same as the colour the word is describing.

I developed this project in order to aid me in winning a game I was playing on my smartphone. The way it works is by continuously taking screenshots of my smartphone and then analysing the pixels in the image. After the analysis is done, a message is displayed on the screen, either 'True' or 'False'.

(might modify this at a later time to use some machine learning algorithms to analyse the pixels in the screenshots)
