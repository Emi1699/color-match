# color-match
Check whether the colour of a word is the same as the colour the word is describing.

I developed this project in order to aid me in winning a game I was playing on my smartphone. The way it works is by continuously taking screenshots of my smartphone and then analysing the pixels in the image. After the analysis is done, a message is displayed on the screen, either 'True' or 'False'.

  Basically, I was trying to cheat. 
  
  Didn't work.
